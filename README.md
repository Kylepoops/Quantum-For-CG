# Quantum

> _An insanely customizable location generation suite, including /rtp, /wild, random spawns, and more!_ 

Quantum is a location generation suite for Minecraft 1.16+. It provides an interface (through plugin extensions) to interact with internal location APIs. Quantum can be configured to generate locations under highly customizable criteria, such as:

- **always** in a forest biome...
- **never** in a water lake...
- **always** near a pig...
- **never** near a zombie...
- **within** 1000 blocks of 0,0...
- AND **never** in a cave!

These are only a few of the many possibilities Quantum's advanced configuration offers. Quantum is very adaptable, and can (and is!) used by many types of servers: Factions, minigames, PvP, and more. Quantum's documentation is constantly growing, so make sure to check out the wiki page and the [Discord server](https://chat.ksc.sh)!
